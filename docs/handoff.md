## 8 October 2026 — Enterprise Conversion & B2B Clarity Overhaul (/india & /uae)

Status: Implemented and fully verified locally across all 73 static SSG routes.

- **Hero Visual & Editorial Overhaul**:
  - Replaced murky AI illustrations with crisp daylight executive fleet imagery: `corporate-hero.jpg` (commercial white coach bus + executive sedans at IT tech park for `/india`) and `uae-hero.jpg` (luxury S-Class + Cullinan with uniformed chauffeurs outside Dubai corporate high-rise for `/uae`).
  - Added editorial gradient ensuring high contrast readability.
  - Aligned hero direct pathways strictly to corporate B2B mobility: Daily Employee Commute, Corporate Campus Shuttles, Executive Chauffeur Retainers, and Airport VIP Transfers.
- **Enterprise Mobility Portfolio (formerly "Three ways to travel with Victor")**:
  - Eliminated consumer wedding convoys from the primary B2B value proposition.
  - Replaced with 3 structured corporate offerings: *Daily Employee Commute Solutions*, *Corporate Campus Bus Transit*, and *Executive & Chauffeur Travel* with concrete enterprise deliverables.
- **Operational Performance & Track Record (formerly "Delivering precision across complex requirements")**:
  - Replaced AI jargon headline with *Operational Track Record & Performance: Proven delivery across high-density corporate mobility*.
  - Replaced unverified consumer/wedding case studies with tangible enterprise operations: *Campus Workforce Transit Architecture (1,200+ daily commuters)*, *International Board Delegation Mobility*, and *Critical 24/7 Operations Shift Fleet Coordination (800+ shift staff, 99.7% on-time)*.
  - Replaced unverified Fortune 500 logo claims with verified industry verticals: IT/ITeS, GCCs, BFSI, Healthcare/Pharma, Consulting, and Manufacturing corridors.
- **Enterprise Compliance Standards**:
  - Replaced consumer fluff with enterprise procurement checkpoints: AIS-140 GPS telematics, 100% BGV & Police Clearance, Night-Shift Female Escort protocols, and transparent SLA invoicing.
- **Operational Presence Grid**:
  - Replaced the bulky SVG map with an authoritative 3-Hub Operational Presence Grid (Hyderabad HQ, Bengaluru Branch, Pune Branch) displaying registered addresses, key tech corridors, and direct dispatch numbers.
  - On `/uae`, removed exaggerated fleet counters in favor of verified corporate limousine capabilities.
- **Enquiry Form UX**:
  - Added dedicated Enterprise / Company Name input field.
  - Replaced raw monospace code block with an executive Enquiry Specification Summary Card.
  - Honest dispatch messaging stating clearly that opening WhatsApp initiates a chat draft and does not constitute a confirmed contract.

Validation:
- TypeScript (`npm run type-check`): passed (0 errors).
- ESLint (`npm run lint`): passed (0 warnings, 0 errors).
- Production Build (`npm run build`): passed (73/73 static SSG pages successfully compiled).
- High-resolution desktop & mobile screenshots captured and verified in `docs/screenshots/overhaul/`.


- Enquiry query defaults now initialise on navigation, without resetting visitor service/city edits, custom-city text or a removed vehicle category on each keystroke.
- Fleet enquiries use real contact links carrying category and service; shared links respect India/UAE routes.
- Retained the pending 1280px desktop-header breakpoint. Reduced primary navigation to five destinations, restored one close button inside the mobile dialog, and fixed the backdrop's containing block and viewport height.
- Portal pages, metadata, roster/scorecard/statement views and sample download consistently describe a demonstration. Removed apparent real customer identities, vehicle/driver assignments, live telemetry, invented performance statistics and payable amounts. No sample roster is sent to operations.
- Replaced the schematic map with simplified geographic state/UT boundaries, three office-state highlights and approximate city markers. City buttons work with keyboard activation and expose pressed state; office details and enquiry links update together. No perpetual marker animation. See `docs/map-attribution.md`.
- Grouped footer navigation and added `/india/business` and `/uae/business` directories so specialist resources remain accessible without dominating primary navigation.

Validation against the local production build:

- TypeScript: passed. ESLint: no warnings/errors. Next production build: all 73 routes generated. Used local Node entry points because the shell's `npm` shim points to a missing npm installation.
- Homepage overflow checks at 320, 390, 768, 1024, 1280 and 1440px: no horizontal document overflow.
- Mobile menu: open/close, Shift+Tab/Tab containment, Escape, restored trigger focus, background inertness and scrollable 320×640 layout checked.
- Fleet → contact: Sedans/category and recommended service retained. Visitor changes to Airport Transfers/Pune and subsequent typing persisted; category removal persisted. Map → contact: Bengaluru prefilled. Other-city input remained editable and appeared in the draft preview.
- Map: desktop Pune and keyboard Bengaluru selection updated the matching office and contact URL. Desktop/mobile screenshots inspected.
- Portal: both example shifts and all three view selectors exercised. Download link's actual text payload and `DEMO-…` filename verified; in-app browser download-event capture timed out, so OS save completion is not certified.
- All 42 India/UAE business-directory destinations exist in the prerender manifest.
- Reduced-motion handling for the changed menu was checked in source; OS-level reduced-motion emulation, screen-reader speech, actual calls and WhatsApp sending were not performed.

Evidence: `docs/screenshots/codex-ui-fixes/` (desktop home/map/business/portal and mobile home/menu/map/enquiry/portal/footer). Scope is these six findings, not a fresh factual certification of every specialist page or the pre-existing company claims.

Release: changes are ready for the normal GitHub/Vercel release workflow. The workspace has no linked `.vercel/project.json`; live-site verification remains a post-deployment step.

## Milestone: Comprehensive UI/UX Audit & Enterprise Redesign Implementation
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Production Ready & Fully Verified with Automated E2E Suites.
- **Platform Scale**: **71 Static SSG Routes**, zero horizontal overflows across 8 viewports (320px–1920px), complete enterprise design system alignment.

---

### Executive Summary & Key Results
A comprehensive, end-to-end visual and functional UI/UX audit was conducted across 8 viewports:
- Small Mobile (320px)
- Mobile (375px, 390px, 430px)
- Tablet (768px, 1024px)
- Desktop (1440px)
- Large Desktop (1920px)

Across 10 core routes (`/india`, `/india/contact`, `/india/services`, `/india/services/employee-transportation`, `/india/fleet`, `/india/about`, `/india/rfp`, `/india/estimator`, `/markets`, `/`).

#### Key Solved Issues:
1. **P0 131px Horizontal Overflow on 1024px Tablets**: Expanded desktop navigation breakpoint in `Header.tsx` from `lg:flex` (1024px) to `xl:flex` (1280px), collapsing the 1155px wide navigation into an accessible drawer on 1024px screens. **Result: 0px overflow across all 71 pages.**
2. **P0 Logo Artifact Line Removal**: Fixed `<image>` raster bleeding in `BrandLogo.tsx` by introducing an explicit SVG `<clipPath id="victor-logo-viewport-clip">` and `overflow-hidden` container. The original Pegasus logo, ®, and "On Time Every Time." tagline remain 100% intact without scanner lines.
3. **P0 Broken Enquiry CustomEvent on Homepage**: Eliminated orphaned `selectEnquiryOption` dispatch on pages without `#enquiry` element by replacing with direct `<Link href="/india/contact">` preserving query parameters.
4. **P1 Footer 1100px Imbalance & Rainbow Links**: Redesigned `Footer.tsx` into an authoritative 4-column enterprise architecture. Removed disparate colored links (`text-purple-300`, `text-amber-400`, `text-emerald-400`, etc.) and unified typography to `text-brand-soft-neutral/75 hover:text-white`.
5. **P1 Fleet Tab Wrapping & Image Hierarchy**: Fleet category selector on mobile now features touch-friendly horizontal swipe (`no-scrollbar shrink-0`). On mobile, the vehicle image renders above vehicle specifications so tab changes immediately display the updated vehicle photograph above the fold.
6. **P1 India Network Map Mobile Hierarchy**: On mobile screens (`< lg`), city selector tabs and registered address cards are prioritized above the vector map (`order-1 lg:order-2`), providing instant contact details and direct calling options without scrolling through a 550px map.
7. **P1 Missing Key Points on Customer Journeys**: Rendered bulleted `keyPoints` checklists on card faces for Corporate, VIP, and Wedding journeys from `india.json`.
8. **P2 WCAG Touch Targets & Typography Contrast**: All buttons, links, and chips upgraded to `min-h-[44px]` touch targets. Disclaimers standardized to readable `text-xs`.
